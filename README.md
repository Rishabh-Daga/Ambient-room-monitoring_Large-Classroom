# Ambient-room-monitoring_Large-Classroom
This is a team project for our Embedded systems workshop.
In this ,we use any of the given two nodes to measure different parameters in a given class room.
The data can be seen on OneM2M server and Thingspeak Channel.
It comprised of two differebt types of nodes(Senosrs in that node):
  1. 3 Sensor node(DHT22,GX MAX 4466,BME280)
  2. 4 Sensor node(T6713, DHT22, BME280 , BH1750)
  
  
# Attached
1. Project documentattion
2. Arduino code for both the nodes including part for OneM2M and Thingspeak too.
